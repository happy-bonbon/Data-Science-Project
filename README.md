- Some data cleaning has been done on weather data.
- Data cleaning on Price table, VIC colume deleted, convert time into date format and then format into string format MM-dd,a,HH:mm. so that later on, we can easily grab the date and time. convert demand to INT, as the floating point number is not that important. No change to the pricing category, all data there are looking great.
